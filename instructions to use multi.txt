set dir to multi.py directory
On your Anaconda terminal type: python multi.py to execute the code.

We need to select all the objects which are risky or affected by the risk. Also any abnormal behavior of any vehicle. (eg. some drivers may get scared by the movement of other vehicles)
This code now supports selection of a maximum of 4 objects. Press the key as per below to select objects:
Space: for selecting the first object.
a: for the second object if any. If you think there is a second object who is risky or will get affected or abnormal behavior.
s: for the third object if any. If you think there is a third object who is risky or will get affected or abnormal behavior.
d: for the fourth object if any. If you think there is a fourth object who is risky or will get affected or abnormal behavior.

After pressing the above keys, you need to hit Enter to continue.
Esc: to unselect all the selected objects
c: when no object is selected, pressing this key will increase the speed of the video.

To restart from the 11th video you need to put "Done" status in the csv file for the first 10 videos. Be careful about the tracking results. Last video results may be partially saved. Before restarting, delete the tracking results of that video.

In the middle of code execution if you need to stop the code, press ctr+c in your anaconda prompt.

To pause in the middle of the video you need to hit 'p'.
Besides that, you can split the csv file (michael_normal.csv) into multiple files if you think that is convenient.


*it seems that the michael_normal.csv file is not being written to
 because of this, I have to move videos that I already watched before next code execution
 when it skips a video, it makes a blank csv file and overwrites what I have already done

*generally, there is a bbox tracking problem when vehicles are obscured

suggestion: enable code to play back video with bounding boxes


6. debris selected, not car
     *go back and deselect since tracking changes to car after hit

24. hard to track first risk, tracking messed up
26. tracking messes up when they approach third truck
29. hard time detecting trailer, i chose only truck
    can i unselect one box and keep other? after they crash, they get mangled
42. this clip is definitely the dashcam driver's fault - they were going too fast
    also, tracking messes up with this clip
53. bbox switches at end


61 REDO, obscuring
67 expands a lot at the end
69 has no other vehicle involved besides self
74 it would be helpful to be able to deselect one option and then reselect due to obscuring
78 bbox switches to other car so I had to switch back
79 second box also doesn't disappear into corner at end
84 commentary: a limitation is that we can't see the left car speeding into the picture beforehand
    bbox switches to debris at end (truncate)

85 REDO, tracking issue
86 tracking box messes up
87 doesn't expand properly
91 REDO, tracking issue
93 tracking jumps to sign
95 obscuring
103 tracking problem near end
104 rear end off camera
106 windshield wiper messes up a small bit
107 REDO, hard to track as it is obscured
115 hard to track, obscuring
skipped 116 which appears to be duplicate
117 car 2 comes in really quickly, tracking messes up with crash and debris
118 it's hard to know a crash will happen before watching - the computer just sees the truck rear end someone suddenly
122 truncate after accident since the video splits
125 REDO, tracking issue
127 REDO, hectic
128 obscuring
132 not dashcam
133 obscuring
137 brief timeskip
138 redo
141 redo
146 redo
147 redo
148 no car to car accident
149 redo, blurry
153 pov rear end
158 redo
164 very end is a bit errored, redo?
166 redo
179redo
*update csv
